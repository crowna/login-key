# login-key
A WordPress plugin offering secure key-file access over http rather than the simple unsecure login and password system.

Among other uses, this allows you to give someone a key to log in as a particular user. They can then login without the need for login name or password.
This key can easily be replaced after that person finished their work. It can even be emailed directly from your WordPress installation.
