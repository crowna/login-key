# login-key
WordPress Plugin login key file alternative to normal login

Good security login system on HTTP sites, that allows you to give someone a key to log in as a particular user. They can then login without the need for login name or
password. 
This key can easily be replaced after that person finished their work. It can even be emailed directly from your WordPress installation.

Uses:
 - allow someone temporary access without having to change a password
 - easy access over many devices
